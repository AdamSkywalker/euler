/**
 * Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
 * <p>
 * It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal,
 * but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime;
 * that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
 * <p>
 * If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed.
 * If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along
 * both diagonals first falls below 10%?
 * <p>
